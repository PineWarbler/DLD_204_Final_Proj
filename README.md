# DLD_204_Final_Proj
Final Design Project for Digital Logic Design (ELEE 204) at Grove City College

An 8-bit, two-register microcontroller built in VHDL with 128 bytes of program memory and 128 bytes of RAM for immediate storage.  It can be programmed by custom machine code instructions; demo programs include:
 - addition
 - division by iterative subtraction
 - multiplication by adding and shifting
 - ${\rm N}^{\rm {th}}$ Fibonacci number generator
 - Square root approximator using the Newton-Raphson iterative approximation method
